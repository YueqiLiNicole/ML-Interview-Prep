This repository is a personal log where I document my preparation process for Machine Learning interviews.

## [Probobility Review](Probability%20Review/Concept.md)
The foundational concepts in probability theory is essential for understanding and applying machine learning methods. We covers everything from the basics of probability spaces to more complex topics like Bayesian inference and random variable distributions.

We include [Fundamental](Probability%20Review/Fundamental.md), [Expectation](Probability%20Review/Expectations.md), and [Distributions](Probability%20Review/Distribution.md) knowlegde about the probability that may used in ML, and also include interview questions about probability
